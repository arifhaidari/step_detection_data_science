Can We Use Both Approaches?
Yes! Different ML models can be used for different purposes:

Approach	Model Type	Use Case
Regression	RandomForest, XGBoost, LSTMs	Predict total step count per measurement session.
Classification	Logistic Regression, SVM, CNN, LSTMs	Identify if a step occurred at each timestamp.
Hybrid (Both)	Combining classifiers and regressors	Detect steps first, then count them.
