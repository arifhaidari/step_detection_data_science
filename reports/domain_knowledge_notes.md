# Notes during work

If the device is in a pocket, az (vertical acceleration) might be the best signal.
If worn on the wrist, gx or gy (rotational motion) might contain useful information.

Gyroscope data (gx, gy, gz) is mostly useful for analyzing gait patterns but not always necessary for step detection.
