# Note during work

Low pass filters can help eliminate the high value data, as it allows only the low values to pass through and ‘stops’ high values from going through the filter.

The limit for a low pass filter can be set manually or they can also be learnt by using machine learning. This is a simple, but powerful, technique that can remove anomalous data.

Additional Note: If scaler is used before train_test_split, data leakage will happen. Do use scaler after train_test_split

The "Fast Fourier Transform" (FFT) is an important measurement method in the science of audio and acoustics measurement. It converts a signal into individual spectral components and thereby provides frequency information about the signal.
